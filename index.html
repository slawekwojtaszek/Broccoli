    <h1> <span class="mark">About</span> Me <div class="line"></div>
    </h1>
    <p>I am resulted from breeding of landrace Brassica crops in the northern Mediterranean starting in about the sixth
      century BCE! I have origins in primitive cultivars grown in the Roman Empire and I was most likely improved via
      artificial selection in the southern Italian Peninsula or in Sicily. I was spread to northern Europe by the 18th
      century and brought to North America in the 19th century by Italian immigrants. After the Second World War,
      breeding of United States and Japanese F1 hybrids increased yields, quality, growth speed, and regional
      adaptation, which produced the cultivars that have been the most popular since then: 'Premium Crop', 'Packman',
      and 'Marathon'.</p>

          <li>Italian immigrants first introduced broccoli to the United States in the 1800s. However, it did not become
            widely know until the 1920s.</li>
          <li>The word broccoli comes from an Italian word broccolo which means “the flowering top of a cabbage”.</li>
          <li>In the United States, California produces 90% of the crop.</li>
          <li> The United States ranks 3rd in the world for production of broccoli. China is ranked 1st and India ranks
            2nd. </li>
